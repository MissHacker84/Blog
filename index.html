        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize" >i had visited in dec 2018</h5>

        <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

      <p> Adam Sandler’s latest film Hustle can be summarized in one word, heart. Every performance from the entire cast showcased what an important story this was into the world of the NBA. The cast carried this passion through its characters, which every character had a purpose and drove it up court. With the script coming from SpringHill Studio’s (Lebron James’ production company) it is no surprise that authenticity was a centric part to the story and actors. Due to this key focus the Popstar & Rocky sports drama mash up did a lot of great things, but still had some shortcomings.
        At the heart of this narrative, we have an undiscovered Spaniard basketball prodigy whose focus is off of the court until he collides with an NBA Scout chasing his dream of being on the bench with 76er’s coaching staff. Once these two are put together dedication, hard work, and a slightly too long training montage has them ready to go up against the world. Hustle never lets reality escape from what challenges lie in their way and gives a fair insight to what our incredible athletes endure just to try and get their name on a jersey. For many first time actors attached to this project, they delivered wonderful performances and really helped set the scale of the stage. With an assemblage of basketball icons from both past and present, and both on and off the court, it is a treat for any NBA fan to watch.
        We also get to see inside the lives of Sugerman and Cruz, but it felt like the writers were playing it safe when going into the challenges they had off the court. By only letting us peer into the repercussions of their past actions vs seeing their current personal obstacles, they were able to make some easy free throws when I would have rather seen them get a slam dunk. This is especially frustrating as they present the chance very early in the movie but don’t do anything with it. 
        Overall, Hustle was a very well done film that was put together neat and clean, and is a present for basketball and movie fans both to enjoy. While nicely wrapped it missed the ribbon on top. </p>

      <p> It is a good film with Samuel Jackson at his best as the basketball coach for a team in his old school Richmond High School. The school is full of students who do not want to study having low percentile scores. the only fact that attracted the poor boys who went to school just for the heck of it, was the basketball coaching. But due to lack of team spirit  these rowdies did not try to excel in the gams. Instead they played the fool and lost most of the games against other schools. Finally the arrival of Ken Carter , a sports goods shop owner , as their coach, changed matters to remedy them into good team players and even good students , as he urged them to work well at their game and their studies. Finally, these young men learnt to play together as a great team and also became better students. College studies with full-fledged scholarships, which was a distant dream for most of them, became a reality for them to achieve phenomenal success in their lives due to the discipline instilled into their psyche by this persevering coach.</p>
